**Issues:**
* Can't move camera in the game/studio
  * Seems to be an issue with some Wine versions, downgrade/upgrade your Wine or use [wine-tkg](https://github.com/Mantas-2155X/illusion-wine-guide/blob/master/parts/packages.md).
* dnSpy crashes / IllusionLauncher is fully black
  * [Disable WPF hardware acceleration](https://github.com/Mantas-2155X/illusion-wine-guide/blob/master/parts/setup-wineprefix.md)

**Compatible OS:**
* Linux (all features)
* MacOS (no DXVK = bad compatibility, performance)

**Confirmed working games:**
* AI Syoujo,
* Emotion Creators,
* Honey Select 1,
* Honey Select 2,
* Koikatsu,

* PlayHome

**Confirmed working applications:**
